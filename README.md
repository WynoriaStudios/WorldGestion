# WorldGestion
Manage your most beautiful world from your Minecraft server.

# Information

This resource is a script that allows for more advanced management of worlds. It only works with the Skript plugin and its SkBee addon (link below).

WorldGestion works on Spigot as well as on Paper but we advise you to use Paper for better stability and optimization of your Minecraft server and its plugins.

This resource has been developed by ourselves since the evening of May 9, 2024 and its first publication was made on Friday May 10, 2024 in the late afternoon.
